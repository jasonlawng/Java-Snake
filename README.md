# Java-Snake
topics used includes but are not limited to: inheritance, array list, timer, JFrame, ActionEvent, ActionListener, KeyEvent, KeyListener, @Override

Some pretty advanced concepts are used in this program I made a while back for my final project for BLI.
At the time I definitely did not understand a majority of these concepts completely since most of it had to be self-taught.

This should serve as an example for future club members to look at for inspiration on their own projects.
